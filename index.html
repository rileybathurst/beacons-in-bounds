        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>We enjoy skiing and snowboarding at our favorite resorts, especially when the snow falls. We line up with
            hopes of getting those sweet powder turns, while we await the patrol to complete their safety checks. We
            have grown accustomed that within these boundaries we are completely safe from the dangers of avalanches. We
            are grateful to the patrol who work tirelessly to open the mountain, but even with these efforts it is truly
            difficult to be perfectly safe in the ever changing environment on a mountain. Snow conditions can change
            quickly and accidents can happen. Avalanches and burials are becoming more common inbounds. We at Beacon in
            Bounds want you to ride another day, so we are promoting the wearing of an avalanche beacon, when the
            conditions warrant, in bounds on your next resort day.</p>

        <p>A beacon can't stop an avalanche but it can help patrol locate you faster and save in the precious minutes
            during a rescue situation. Add a beacon to your daily gear list, put it on when conditions are right, and
            turn it on for the day of shredding.</p>

        <h2>The ways to help</h2>

        <h3>Everyone</h3>
        <p>When you ski on a powder day at a resort please wear a beacon, talk to your friends and family about the
            advantages of wearing a beacon and learn how to use it.</p>

        <p>Post to social media and group chat's #beaconsinbounds, get the word out and keep the conversation going.</p>

        <h3>Those with a story to tell</h3>
        <p>If you have had a good or bad experience and would like to share.</p>

        <h3>Patrollers, Educators and others with avalanche knowledge</h3>
        <p>If you have the knowledge to help with this website and think we can do better in any aspect please send us a
            message and we will do our best to update the message we send out.</p>

        <h3>Resorts, brands and Organizations</h3>
        <p>If you wish to and have the ability to help financially all we are asking for is printed materials, stickers,

                <p>The Idea for #BeaconsInBounds came to me after yet another member of my community passed away in an
                    inbound avalanche. Growing up in New Zealand I spent time snowboarding at the tiny club fields where
                    safety is really your own responsibility and your group all rode prepared for a rescue with gear and
                    knowledge as if we were in the backcountry. After spending more time at commercial fields in the
                    Northern Hemisphere I found the safety of resort riding culture to be more relaxed. I donâ€™t want to
                    see the ski community suffer the devastating loss of another member and hope to inspire more to take
                    the reins on their personal safety, plus this seemed like a nice little hashtag.</p>
